SQL databases are relational databases that have a pre-defined and fixed schema that all entries must fulfill. Examples of SQL databases include Oracle and MySQL. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are a key-value store. They have dynamic structures, so each row in the database need not have the exact same structure. For example, a particular entry may have values for 2 columns while another entry may have values for 5 columns. NoSQL databases provide flexibility for storing unstructured data. Examples of NoSQL databases include DynamoDB and MongoDB.
